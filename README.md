This will someday be a scaled up version of tic tac toe. Currently, it's a few unfinished implementations of regular tic tac toe. It started as a React app several months ago, but that proved to be a bit outside of my skill range. I'm working on a tic tac toe implementation in python to get a handle on the mechanics of the game in a language I understand before including the web programming.

In python, I am using tkinter as the UI. There is a working game board as of now, without any game logic.
