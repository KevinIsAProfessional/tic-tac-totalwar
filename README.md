# Tic Tac Totalwar

This is an implementation of nine board Tic Tac Toe. 

Every move that is played influences where the next move can be played. 
For example, if Player 1 captures the top left square of a small board, Player 2 must then capture a square in the top left board.

To win, capture three boards in a row.
